Instructions for pushing changes through file and database backups.

# Push and Deploy Backup Assets

Make your changes locally or in the appropriate environment. Once the changes have been made, perform the actions necessary for your platform to produce the file or database backup needed.

- For site files, create as a tar.gz file.
- For a database, create a SQL dump file.

### To Create Drupal Backups

Connect to your Drupal web instance. If you are using DDEV-Local, you can use the ddev ssh command to connect to the web container.

To backup the database, run

```
drush sql-dump --gzip > database-backup.sql.gz
```

To backup the site files, run

```
tar -zcvf file-backup.tar.gz /path/to/site
```

### To Create WordPress Backups

Connect to your WordPress web instance. If you are using DDEV-Local, you can use the ddev ssh command to connect to the web container.

To backup the database, from the WordPress root directory, run `wp db export /path/to/database-backup.sql` to generate the SQL backup, then run `gzip /path/to/database-backup.sql` to compress the resulting file.

To backup the site files, from the WordPress root directory, run `tar -zcvf file-backup.tar.gz .` (note the dot at the end, to ensure all files in the directory are included)
