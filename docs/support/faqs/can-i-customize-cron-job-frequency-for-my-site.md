On DDEV Live, the default for cron jobs in Drupal applications is hourly. If you need changes to that default, please submit a support ticket.

There is no default cron job for WordPress applications, if you have custom cron job requirements please submit a ticket.

Allowing customers the ability to configure cron frequency is in our API roadmap.
