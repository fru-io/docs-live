## Email
DDEV-Live does not provide SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server or Sendmail functionality. This means that your applications cannot rely on PHP's built-in mail functions to ensure mail delivery.

We recommend leveraging a 3rd party transactional email service such as SendGrid, Mandrill, or Mailgun. Many of these 3rd parties provide module or plugin support for your CMSs or provide SMTP configuration.
