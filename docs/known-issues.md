# Known issues

- You may see a 503 or a 502 error at a newly generated [site's](sites.md) URL for a period of time.
- When you make a change in the [GitHub](github.md) repo for a previously deployed [site](sites.md) you do not have the ability to check on the status of the deployment from the CLI.
- It can take up to 3 seconds after site creation for the `ddev-live describe` command to succeed.
- `ddev-live push files` does not yet work with an archive of the entire files directory.
